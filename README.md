# Suicide Detection
According to Baylor University, most people who die by suicide talk about it first, often reaching out to others for help or because they are in pain or distress.  Many people who do talk seriously about suicide can be helped with appropriate intervention and professional help.
While the rate of suicide has declined since peaking in 2018, nearly 46,000 people died by suicide in the United States in the year 2020.  Today there are more ways than ever to connect digitally and many conversations about suicide happen online and on social media.  

The purpose of this project is to develop a model to interpret written text and categorize it as suicidal or non-suicidal.  This type of model could be used to review large text datasets and flag text using language consistent with suicidal postings.  Such a system could be used by social media companies or by schools or parents who wish to monitor for suicidal tendencies in authors in order to intervene before anything catestrophic occurs.  Additionally, a number of private firms including Betterhelp, Talkspace and 7 Cups offer online counseling including chat functions through an app.  The  ability to screen written communication through counseling apps could help therapy providers more easily identify patients who begin using language consitent with suicidal patients.  With appropriate permissions, these apps could even monitor outgoing text messages or other written communications of patients to flag language consistent with suicidal tendencies even if it is not directed at the therapist.
