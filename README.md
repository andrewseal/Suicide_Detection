# Suicide Detection
This project would examines text from two sources.  The first data source is a suicide watch subreddit and the second is a teenager forum on the same site.  The goal of this project is to use natural language processing to determine the source of each posting and to identify language patterns consistent with people posting about suicide.  This type of model could be used by schools, parents, or social media companies to create alerts that would notify parents or other interested parties when a person is posting content consistent with language of those who are contemplating suicide.  Alerts of these types could be issued with the idea of intervening and preventing crisis.
